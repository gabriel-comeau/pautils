Pulse Audio Utilities
========

Pulseaudio is a modern linux audio subsystem.  It is backed
by Ubuntu, and offers an intermediate abstraction between
audio devices and their legacy drivers, and a wide range
of applications.

There are capable GUI interfaces to Pulseaudio, allowing application
streams to be manipulated with a high degree of precision.  However,
the scripting capabiliites and command line tools are not yet fully
developed.

This repository provides some higher level functionality
for taking control of your audio on a per-app basis
from the command line.
