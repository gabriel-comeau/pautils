Pulseaudio is the audio subsystem used in ubuntu, and seems
to be gaining some level of traction within the linux world.

Sadly, the level of control available of the system from
the command line is relatively limited.

This repository provides some higher level functionality
for maintaining control of your audio on a per-app basis
from the command line.
